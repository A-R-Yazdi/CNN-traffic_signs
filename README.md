# Traffic signs classification with CNN 

## Summary
In this project, ~40,000 images of 43 unique German traffic signs were used to build a CNN model for traffic sign classification. First the distrubution of data was explored and then data was read, resized and normalized and the results were split into training and testing subsets and shuffled. CNN model (4 convolutional layers and 1 dense layer) was build and could achieve accuracy of >99%!
